# dungeon
team 9 project

This is a text-based dungeon game where you select a hero and then fight monsters using your abilities. Each class has different stats and abilities so it's up to preference
which one is the best. The classes all have differences but they all have some commonalities, such as the ability to heal. There are also a variety of monsters to fight that have
different stats and abilites of their own. If enough monsters are defeated then the player will get to the main task: fight the Dragon.
