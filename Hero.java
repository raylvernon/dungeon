 * Title: Hero.java
 *
 * Description: Abstract base class for a hierarchy of heroes.  It is derived
 *  from DungeonCharacter.  A Hero has battle choices: regular attack and a
 *  special skill which is defined by the classes derived from Hero.
 *
 *  class variables (all are directly accessible from derived classes):
 *    chanceToBlock -- a hero has a chance to block an opponents attack
 *    numTurns -- if a hero is faster than opponent, their is a possibility
 *                for more than one attack per round of battle
 *
 *  class methods (all are public):
 *    public Hero(String name, int hitPoints, int attackSpeed,
				     double chanceToHit, int damageMin, int damageMax,
					 double chanceToBlock)
	  public void readName()
	  public boolean defend()
	  public void subtractHitPoints(int hitPoints)
	  public void battleChoices(DungeonCharacter opponent)
